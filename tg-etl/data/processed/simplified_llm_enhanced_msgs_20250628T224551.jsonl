At the time, the United States actively discussed a preemptive strike on North Korea. Former Defense Secretary **William Perry** wrote in detail about the preparation for this operation in his memoirs.\n\n❓More than **30 years** have passed, the realities in North Korea have changed, but is a strike possible? The mood in the local media is ambiguous, but the prevailing answer is that __such an operation is unlikely.__\n\n🖍Firstly, unlike Iran, North Korea is already a **nuclear power de facto**. Moreover, Pyongyang's ability to inflict damage on the Americans exceeds that of Tehran.\n\n🚩Secondly, Pyongyang has two allies - **Beijing** and **Moscow**. According to two treaties, if one side is attacked, the other must provide military assistance.\n\nAnd although China's participation in a hypothetical conflict remains a debatable issue, the \"testing\" of the Russian-North Korean treaty in the **Kursk region** showed that this document does work. This means that the likelihood of Russia's participation on the side of its ally is greatly increased.\n\n➡️What the local media calls __\"Kim's obsession with nuclear weapons\"__ is now effectively saving North Korea from the Iranian scenario. The current situation also adds points against the formulations about **the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula** - a mantra that was considered the basis for any negotiations with the North Koreans.\n\n❗️Therefore, any possible dialogue, whether the US, its allies, or even China like it or not, will be built on different principles. And the Americans themselves have once again created the prerequisites for such changes, **adding confidence** to Pyongyang that getting rid of nuclear weapons is more trouble than it's worth.\n#Iran #NorthKorea #USA\n⭐️@rybar\n\n💸[**Support us**](https://qr.nspk.ru/BS1A0068ID10D33B9IBAQRQ4M9T0NIFN?type=01&bank=100000000008&crc=36CB) [Original msg](https://t.me/rybar/71579)", "telegram_url": "https://t.me/rybar_in_english/23118", "media_type": "MessageMediaWebPage", "geolocation": {"lat": 32.4279, "lon": 53.688, "confidence": 0.9974999999999999, "source": "country_centroid_override", "place_name": "Iran"}}

Then he faces a long and painstaking CQC and other types of training and exercises as part of a combat group, where it is revealed whether he can withstand such a pace of life and is capable of performing tasks in this team or not.\n\n💭We also note the selection of young officers.\n\nIn some Special Operations Forces units, cadets are \"guided\" from the junior courses.\n\nHere's how it works. Over the past 3 years, the teaching staff has undergone some changes, and now there are people with extensive combat and command experience, including participation in the SMO. And as a rule, these people are in touch with their unit and can always provide a detailed description of the future personnel. After the next graduation, the command of the Special Operations Forces unit conducts additional tests and trials for young officers, based on the results of which a decision is made about their further service in this unit.\n\n✍️ If this experience is extended to all units, and not just a certain part of them, then the issue of training personnel to perform various tasks will be resolved.\n\n[Spetsnaz Archangel.

Meanwhile, numerous episodes have been recorded on the ground where mustard gas and other chemical agents were used by the armed opposition - including strikes on residential areas and military facilities.\n\n🚩Now, with a significant part of **Syria**'s territory under the control of structures directly linked to the former **Al-Qaeda** alliances, the situation has changed dramatically. Representatives of the **Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)** have arrived in **Damascus** for \"talks about transparent cooperation\". Prior to this, for many years, the **OPCW** did not demonstrate such activity or interest in dialogue, preferring to act on the basis of accusations without field verifications in areas under **Damascus**' control.\n\n🏳️How was it possible to redefine the status of those who were recently called terrorists so sharply? The answer lies in the documentary base published by **Consortium News** in **2020**.\n\n❗️According to the leak, Western structures - including government contractors from **Britain** and the **US** - have been building a propaganda infrastructure to support the Syrian opposition since the beginning of the conflict. Under the contracts, media platforms were developed, branding of the moderate opposition, production of visual content, including staged content, which was supplied to major channels - from **BBC** to **Al Jazeera**.\n\n💀This information architecture created the necessary framework: the **Syrian** government was portrayed as a \"regime poisoning its own population\", and the opposition groups as defenders of freedom. At the same time, as confirmed by the internal reports of the contractors, these same structures cooperated with formations linked to \"Jabhat al-Nusra\" (Al-Qaeda in Syria), including in the field of local governance and security.\n\n❗️Today's meeting between OPCW representatives and the new \"authorities\" in Damascus is a direct consequence of the change in the narrative. Those who were previously demonized have now become \"handshakable\" - not least because significant resources and efforts have been invested in their legitimization. The whitewashing of militants, the reformatting of concepts and selective \"human rights\" - all this became possible thanks to the long and large-scale media work that began long before the start of formal negotiations.\n#Syria #terrorism\n⭐️@rybar\n\n💸[**Support us**](https://qr.nspk.ru/BS1A0068ID10D33B9IBAQRQ4M9T0NIFN?type=01&bank=100000000008&crc=36CB) [Original msg](https://t.me/rybar/71427)", "telegram_url": "https://t.me/rybar_in_english/23066", "media_type": "MessageMediaWebPage", "geolocation": {"lat": 33.51307, "lon": 36.309581, "confidence": 1.0, "source": "mapbox_city_with_hint", "place_name": "Damascus, Syria"}}

Хезболла ослаблена, но все равно контролирует юг страны, и правительство Ливана не может с ней справиться.\n\nТо есть, при правильном подходе, группы операторов БПЛА могли доставить Израилю массу проблем. Но в нужное время войска БПЛА созданы не были, и все наработки Ирана в этой области оказались невостребованными.\n\nЭто лишь один пример. С ракетным вооружением ситуация примерно такая же - создав запас весьма годных баллистических ракет, Иран не просчитал, как будут проходить системы ПВО.\n\nВ общем, невыученные уроки других - это всегда повод учиться самим.

It mapped Iranian radar systems, EW complexes, and SAMs — paving the way for Israeli Air Force operations.\n▪️Strikes on Iranian air defense and military sites hit the very regions previously scouted — including Kermanshah, Sobashi, and Hamadan, where major radar hubs were located.\n\n🔻What was partially confirmed:\n\n▪️There is no official proof of U.S. involvement in the strikes, but the scale and nature of intelligence coordination suggests open operational support for Israel. While Trump distracted with rhetoric, U.S. intel quietly helped identify targets.\n▪️The impact on Iran–U.S. negotiations remains unclear, but serious consequences — including a breakdown in talks — are likely.\n▪️Israel showed no “foreign policy restraint.” While we considered the strikes might just be a show of force — which initially seemed the case — Israel has now begun hitting high-value targets like refineries.\n\n📌The situation is unfolding predictably: NATO is no passive observer.

According to the rector of the KNU, Dogdurbek Chontoev, the event is intended to strengthen ties between young professionals of the Commonwealth countries.\n\n📌Against the backdrop of the overall negative trend in Central Asia - from anti-Russian outbursts to rewriting textbooks to please Western donors - such **local initiatives are especially valuable.** Because true neighborliness is not based on paper memorandums, but on live communication.\n\nTherefore, if we want to promote an agenda alternative to the West's divisive narratives, such events need to be supported and strengthened. They become the link between countries where official rhetoric is increasingly at odds with real historical experience.\n#Kyrgyzstan #CentralAsia #Russia\n⭐️@rybar\n\n💸[**Support us**](https://qr.nspk.ru/BS1A0068ID10D33B9IBAQRQ4M9T0NIFN?type=01&bank=100000000008&crc=36CB) [Original msg](https://t.me/rybar/71335)", "telegram_url": "https://t.me/rybar_in_english/23019", "media_type": "MessageMediaWebPage", "geolocation": {"lat": 41.2044, "lon": 74.7661, "confidence": 1.0, "source": "country_centroid_override", "place_name": "Kyrgyzstan"}}

The collective West and its Mockingbird media, the same ilk that turned a blind eye to Wahhabi fighters in Bosnia and NATO bombs in Belgrade, still dares to frame him as the singular face of “genocide” while sanitizing the war crimes of its own hands. Mladić is rotting in a cell that can’t, or won’t, treat him. His health is failing, the motion for early release has been filed, and Russia’s previous offers to provide medical assistance were arrogantly dismissed.\n\nLet’s be clear: Mladić’s conviction was never about justice. It was about narrative control. The West needed a scapegoat, a Serb Milosevic didn’t deliver, and so Mladić and Karadžić became the poster villains in a script written by NATO, printed by CNN, and rubber-stamped by The Hague.\n\nWhich brings us to the missed moment, the one Rybar hints at, and which must now be said plainly: Russia could have stepped in. An exchange—Mladić and Karadžić for captured British or American mercenaries in Donbass, was floated in 2022. It never happened. But imagine if it had.\n\nThat would have been a seismic act of soft power. Not a PR stunt, a statement of multipolar loyalty. One that says: “We remember who stood with us when the West came with bombs and lies. We don’t forget our brothers.”\n\nInstead, silence. And now, the lion of the Republika Srpska dies like a forgotten man. Except he’s not forgotten. Not in Serbia. Not in Republika Srpska. And not in the multipolar world that’s watching, learning, recalibrating.\n\nMladić is much more than a man. He’s a symbol of unresolved war memory. Of the double standards that defined the unipolar world. And his final days are a test, and not just of Western hypocrisy, but of **whether Russia is ready to reclaim its historic role as protector of those left bleeding by the empire’s retreat.**\n\nRybar is right: minimal effort, maximum strategic return. And not just for Serbia. For Russia. For the message it sends from the Balkans to Bakhmut: __we don’t abandon our own.__\n\nThat’s what makes a civilization, not just a state.\n\n[Original post here.](https://t.me/rybar_in_english/22984)", "telegram_url": "https://t.me/rybar_in_english/23018", "media_type": "MessageMediaWebPage", "geolocation": {"lat": 28.592403, "lon": 77.19187, "confidence": 0.9974999999999999, "source": "mapbox_country", "place_name": "Yugoslavia Embassy, Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, New Delhi, Delhi, India"}}
